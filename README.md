This repository demonstrates a common PHP error related to type juggling and type hinting. The `calculateSum` function is designed to take an array of integers and return their sum. However, the input array `$numbers` contains a string value ('3'), leading to a type juggling error and a PHP notice.  The solution shows how to correctly handle potential string values or mixed array types to prevent unexpected behavior.
